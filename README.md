Let's say we want to create a movie, and have a responsibility for EUR 10 million of budget. To be able to make decisions, we should know a little bit more about movies made in the past.
Luckily, there are some datasets easily available online. [For example, Kaggle offers large collections of datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) from which we have taken a dataset with all movie data from the past.

## Questions to answer
* The 5 most rated films (top to bottom)
* The 5 most hired actors (top to bottom)
* The 2 most appearing movie genres (top to bottom)
* The % of male-female ratio (biggest % smallest)
